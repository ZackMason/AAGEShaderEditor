# AAGEShaderEditor

This template was created using `cpp_init.py` https://github.com/ZackMason/cpp_init

A simple shader editor using AAGE.

Right now only 2D screen shaders are supported, the ability to load textures, models, and animations will be added later.

Press R to reload the shader and uniforms
